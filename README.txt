Intro to Blockchain
Final Project
David Crowe

Donkey & Elephany Voting dApp


1) Installations needed to run my code:
Node.js v8+ LTS and npm - https://nodejs.org/en/
Git - https://git-scm.com/
Truffle - npm install -g truffle
Ganache - https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache
Metamask - https://metamask.io/download.html


2) How to run my code:
Step 1 - Read the Project Summary "project_summary.txt"
Step 2 - Watch the Quicktime video "blockchain_final_presentation". The video can be found in the root project folder
Step 3 - Open a terminal and navigate to the root project folder 
Step 4 - Open a Ganache private blockchain
Step 5 - Run the command "truffle compile"
Step 6 - Run the command "truffle migrate"
Step 7 - Run the command "truffle test" 
Step 8 - Run the command "npm run dev". This will automatically open the front end user interface in a browser
Step 9 - Copy the private key for one of the accounts from Ganache
Step 10 - Import the account in MetaMask using the private key
Step 11 - Vote using the user interface
Step 12 - Increase gas and accept the transaction in MetaMask
Step 13 - Congrats, you have voted!
Step 14 - Note that each voter is only allowed to vote a single time. Therefore, if you want to vote again, you must change addresses in MetaMask.


3) Material & Resources Referenced:
Mastering Ethereum (https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook). This was an invaluable resource, particularly around implementing smart contracts. 

Truffle Ethereum Pet Shop tutorial (https://www.trufflesuite.com/tutorials/pet-shop). Much of the front end of my dApp (including app.js) was adapted from the Pet Shop material. This was by far the best resource I found on building the front end of a dApp!


4) Additional instructions for the grader:
Please be sure to watch the Quicktime video "blockchain_final_presentation"! 

Aside from that, thank you for a wonderful semester. I definitely leave this class with far more Blockchain knowledge than I entered it!
