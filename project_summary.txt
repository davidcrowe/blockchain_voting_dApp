Donkey & Elephany Voting dApp - Project Summary


Concept:
The Elephant & Donkey Voting dapp is traditional blockchain code/prototype dapp that lets users vote for their
preferred animal – elephant or donkey – and store their vote in an immutable, cryptographically secure and
distributed fashion. The Elephant & Donkey Voting dapp allows you to:

• Vote from your browser. No driving to the polling station!
• Enable a transparent, publically auditable election
• Build a deterministic record of votes


Suitability for Blockchain:
The Elephant & Donkey Voting dApp takes advantage of a number of the benefits of blockchain based systems:

• Decentralization allows for secure votes - no single entity has control over the results
• Immutability allows for secure votes - votes cannot be changed or deleted
• Public ledger blockchains allow for auditable vote history - anyone can download the results & verify vote counts


Implementation:
The Elephant & Donkey Voting dApp implementation includes:
• A smart contract written in Solidity and developed and tested using Remix and Truffle
• A Ganache personal blockchain for development
• Javascript web3 for application logic with an HTML & CSS frontend. These files are stored within the ./src/ folder
• Integration with MetaMask

Also included is a "record screen" video showing implementation and workflow of the dApp.
